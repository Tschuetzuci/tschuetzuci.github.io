I am a trained social scientist with a BA in Media, Communication and Cultural Studies from the University of Bremen, Germany (2012–2017). Currently, I am a master‘s student in Science and Technology Studies (STS) at the Goethe University Frankfurt and the University of California, Irvine (2018-19). 

My research interests focus on (alternative) digital technologies and infrastructures, hacker politics and culture, media and migration, critical humanitarianism, institutional ethnography as well as technology in the old age.

I am a fellow of the German National Academic Foundation (SDV) and the German-American Fulbright Foundation.
